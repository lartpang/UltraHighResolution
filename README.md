# Ultra-High Resolution

## Ultra-High Resolution Segmentation

### Datasets

* **DeepGlobe**: The DeepGlobe dataset contains 803 ultra-high resolution images (2448×2448 pixels). The dense annotation contains 7 classes of landscape regions, where one class out of seven called “unknown” region is not considered in the challenge.
* **ISIC**: The ISIC Lesion Boundary Segmentation Challenge dataset contains 2594 ultra-high resolution images. We randomly split images into training, validation and testing sets with 2074, 260, and 260 images respectively.
* **Inria Aerial**: The Inria Aerial Challenge dataset contains 180 ultrahigh resolution images, each with 5000×5000 pixels.
* **TGRS-HRRSD-Dataset** ([Links](https://github.com/CrazyStoneonRoad/TGRS-HRRSD-Dataset)): High Resolution Remote Sensing Detection (HRRSD). HRRSD contains 21,761 images acquired from Google Earth and Baidu Map with the spatial resolution from 0.15-m to 1.2-m. There are 55,740 object instances in HRRSD. HRRSD contains 13 categories of RSI objects. Moreover, this dataset is divided as several subsets, image numbers in each subset are 5401 for ‘train’, 5417 for ‘val’, and 10943 for ‘test’. And ‘train-val’ subset is a merge of ‘train’ and ‘val’.
